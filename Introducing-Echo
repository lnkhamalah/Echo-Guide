## 📖 Purpose and Goals

This repository documents the **natural language programming prompt and design philosophy behind Echo Guide as implemented on the OpenAI platform**.

The guiding goals of Echo Guide:
- Provide emotionally fluent, nonclinical support in a warm and respectful tone.
- Recognize and reflect emotional patterns without pathologizing.
- Help users gently reframe narratives and foster self-trust.
- Emphasize privacy and autonomy: Echo Guide stores no data unless explicitly requested during a session.
- Support cultural and trauma contexts (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, military, survivors) without categorizing users.

## 💡 Core Features

- **Warm clarity with occasional humor:** Echo Guide maintains warmth while acknowledging the complexity of trauma.
- **Reflective support flow:** Exploratory questioning, theme recognition, and language scaffolding for emotional expression.
- **"Copy That Now" summaries:** Optional user-directed summaries for insight retention (session-only memory).
- **Crisis scaffolding:** Ethical response pathways that refer users to professional or peer resources when needed.
- **Privacy-first:** No persistent storage; all reflection is session-contained unless the user explicitly opts to "hold" an insight.
